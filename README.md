# Welcome to Dino
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/austinbv/dino.png)](http://travis-ci.org/austinbv/dino)

## Get started in no time
Dino was designed to help you start working with your Arduino in minutes.

> * `gem install dino`
> * Burn the file `src/du.ino` to your Arduino
> ** You can do this in the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/software)
> * Plug in your Arduino and wire the led like in `examples/led/led.png`
> * Run `ruby example/led/led.rb`

By now you should be blinking away


Take a look in the example directory for more information


I gave a [talk on this library at RubyConf](http://confreaks.com/videos/1294-rubyconf2012-arduino-the-ruby-way), you can see the slides here: [Arudino The Ruby Way](https://speakerdeck.com/austinbv/arduino-the-ruby-way)
